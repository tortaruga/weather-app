## overview
Web app that displays weather information about any city. Made as practice on using tailwind css and working with API keys without backend.
This app uses [weather api](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

#### design
I wanted to make the design simple but pleasant to look at, so I chose to use some pretty illustrations as background, and I thought it would be a cool touch to have the illustration change based on the local time of the location searched.

#### api

This project was an exercise in working with an API that requires an authentication key, without having to use backend technologies. To do this, I used Netlify Functions, which allowed me to securely hide the key in a front-end only environment. The project was also a useful way to strengthen my skills in working with APIs in general and handling errors.
